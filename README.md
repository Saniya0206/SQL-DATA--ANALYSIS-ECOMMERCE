# üìä SQL for Data Analysis ‚Äì Ecommerce Dataset

A structured SQL project performing data analysis on a simulated ecommerce dataset using advanced querying techniques.

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on extracting meaningful business insights using SQL from an ecommerce database. The dataset includes tables for customers, orders, products, and payments. Core SQL concepts like joins, aggregations, subqueries, views, and indexing were applied.
